# Simple One-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

## Overview

This project illustrates a basic web infrastructure using a single server to host the website **www.foobar.com**.

## Diagram Explanation

The diagram shows the flow of a user request to the website and how it is handled by the components inside the server.

### Components

- **User (Browser)**: The person who wants to visit www.foobar.com.
- **DNS**: Translates the domain name `www.foobar.com` into the server IP address `8.8.8.8`.
- **Server (IP: 8.8.8.8)**: The physical or virtual machine hosting the website.
- **Nginx (Web Server)**: Receives HTTP requests and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Application Server**: Runs the website's code and processes business logic.
- **Application Files**: The actual codebase of the website.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores and retrieves data needed by the application.

### Request Flow

1. The user types **www.foobar.com** in their browser.
2. The browser asks DNS for the IP address of **www.foobar.com**.
3. DNS responds with the IP `8.8.8.8`.
4. The browser sends the HTTP request to the server at `8.8.8.8`.
5. Nginx receives the request.
6. If the request needs dynamic processing, Nginx forwards it to the application server.
7. The application server runs the code, accesses the database if needed.
8. The application server sends the response back to Nginx.
9. Nginx sends the final response to the user's browser.
10. The user sees the website.

## Important Notes

- The domain name **www.foobar.com** uses a **DNS A record** pointing to the server IP.
- The server communicates with the user via the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol**.
- This single-server setup has some limitations:
  - **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: If the server goes down, the website is unavailable.
  - **Downtime during maintenance**: Restarting Nginx or deploying new code causes downtime.
  - **Limited scalability**: Cannot handle very high traffic without upgrading or adding servers.

This simple architecture is common for small websites but may need improvements for high availability and scalability.
