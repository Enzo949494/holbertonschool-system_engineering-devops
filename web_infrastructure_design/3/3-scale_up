# Scaled-Up Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview
This diagram illustrates a scaled-up web infrastructure with component separation and high availability.

## Components

### Load Balancer Cluster
- **2 HAProxy load balancers** configured in a cluster (active-passive)
- Distributes incoming traffic and provides failover capability
- Connected by heartbeat protocol to synchronize state

### Server Components (Separated)
1. **Web Server (Nginx/Apache)**
   - Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests
   - Serves static content
   - Forward requests to application server

2. **Application Server**
   - Executes application code
   - Processes business logic
   - Communicates with database

3. **Database Server**
   - Stores application data
   - Processes database queries

## Benefits
- **High Availability**: Load balancer cluster prevents single point of failure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component performs specialized tasks
- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
- **Security**: Improved with separate component boundaries
- **Maintenance**: Components can be updated/restarted separately

## Data Flow
1. Client sends request to load balancer
2. Active load balancer forwards request to web server
3. Web server passes request to application server
4. Application server processes request, queries database if needed
5. Response follows reverse path back to client
